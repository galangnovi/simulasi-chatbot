# 🕊️ SPEAKLIFE APP

SpeakLIFE is a chat-based counseling platform that intelligently detects emergency messages—such as signs of suicidal intent—sending instant alerts to emergency response communities through Telegram, while providing insightful annual statistics on critical message trends.

---

## 🧠 Overview

SpeakLIFE empowers people to share their feelings through chat-based counseling sessions while using AI and workflow automation to detect critical or emergency messages.  
When messages indicate high-risk intent (e.g., suicidal thoughts or severe distress), the system automatically triggers alerts to emergency response teams via Telegram and logs data for long-term statistical analysis.
